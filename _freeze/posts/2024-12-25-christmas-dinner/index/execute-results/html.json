Our menu for the night was Hickory roasted ham, Mashed potaotes, brussel sprouts and cinnamon buns! Below are the recipies for each of the meals. \n\n## Hickory roasted ham \n\n### Ingredients\n\n- **For the Ham**:\n  - 1 (8-10 lbs) bone-in ham\n  - 1 cup hickory wood chips (soaked in water for 30 minutes)\n  - 2 tbsp olive oil\n  - Salt and pepper to taste\n\n- **For the Honey Glaze**:\n  - 1 cup honey\n  - 1/2 cup brown sugar\n  - 1/4 cup Dijon mustard\n  - 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n  - 2 tbsp soy sauce\n  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon\n  - 1 tsp ground cloves\n  - 1/2 tsp ground ginger\n  - 1/2 tsp ground black pepper\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. **Preheat the Oven**\n   Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).\n\n### 2. **Prepare the Ham**\n   - Pat the ham dry with paper towels.\n   - Rub the ham with olive oil, salt, and pepper to season the surface.\n\n### 3. **Prepare the Honey Glaze**\n   - In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the honey, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper.\n   - Stir the ingredients together and bring to a simmer.\n   - Let the glaze simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.\n\n### 4. **Smoke the Ham**\n   - Place the soaked hickory wood chips in a smoker box or directly on the grill.\n   - Put the ham in the smoker or on the grill over indirect heat. Smoke for 2-3 hours, basting occasionally with the honey glaze.\n   \n### 5. **Roast the Ham**\n   - Once the ham has been smoked, transfer it to the oven. Roast for an additional 1-1.5 hours, basting with the honey glaze every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C).\n\n### 6. **Rest and Serve**\n   - Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\n   - Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy!\n\n## Tips:\n- **For a crispy outer layer**, increase the temperature to 400°F during the last 10 minutes of roasting.\n- **Leftovers** can be sliced and used for sandwiches or added to soups.\n\n\n![](christmas-2024-01.jpeg)\n\n\n## Mashed Potatoes Recipe\n\n\n### Ingredients\n\n- 2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 large potatoes)\n- 1/2 cup unsalted butter\n- 1 cup whole milk (or heavy cream for extra richness)\n- Salt, to taste\n- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- 2 cloves garlic (optional)\n- Chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. **Prepare the Potatoes**\n   - Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\n   - If you like garlic mashed potatoes, you can add the garlic cloves, peeled, to the pot while boiling the potatoes.\n\n### 2. **Boil the Potatoes**\n   - Place the potatoes (and garlic, if using) in a large pot and cover with cold water.\n   - Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat.\n   - Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.\n\n### 3. **Drain the Potatoes**\n   - Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and return them to the pot.\n   - If you added garlic, remove it from the pot.\n\n### 4. **Mash the Potatoes**\n   - Use a potato masher or a potato ricer to mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.\n   - For ultra-smooth potatoes, you can use a ricer, which will give them a silky texture.\n\n### 5. **Add Butter and Milk**\n   - Add the butter to the mashed potatoes and stir until fully melted and incorporated.\n   - Gradually pour in the milk (or heavy cream), stirring until the potatoes are creamy and smooth.\n   - Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n\n### 6. **Serve**\n   - Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.\n   - Serve warm and enjoy!\n\n\n![](christmas-2024-02.jpeg)\n\n\n\n## Brussel Sprouts \n\n### Ingredients\n\n- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 2 tbsp maple syrup\n- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n- Salt, to taste\n- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- 1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional)\n- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)\n- Chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)\n- Bacon (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. **Preheat the Oven**\n   Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\n### 2. **Prepare the Brussels Sprouts**\n   - Trim the ends of the Brussels sprouts and remove any yellow or damaged outer leaves.\n   - Cut them in half lengthwise to ensure even cooking.\n\n### 3. **Toss with Olive Oil and Seasonings**\n   - In a large bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional garlic powder and red pepper flakes.\n   - Make sure the Brussels sprouts are evenly coated with oil and seasonings.\n\n### 4. **Maple Syrup Glaze**\n   - Drizzle the maple syrup and balsamic vinegar over the Brussels sprouts, then toss again to coat evenly.\n\n### 5. **Roast the Brussels Sprouts**\n   - Spread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a baking sheet, cut side down for crispiness.\n   - Roast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the Brussels sprouts are golden brown and crispy on the edges.
