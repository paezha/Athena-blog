The courses I am taking this year are GEOG 712: Reproducibility in Research and MED SCI 771: Research Methodology in Basic Health Science. I am currently conducting research the lab of Dr. Katherine Morrison speicalizing in the pediatric obesity. Our research is related to energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body’s metabolic adaptation to weight loss where an individual’s resting energy expenditure decreases as one loses more weight. This can cause cycles of weight regain, increasing risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our research measured energy expenditure using whole room calorimetry in our energy lab in HSC. This brand new state of the art room allows us to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and using a validated equation, we can then use this to derive energy expenditure.\nAside from my education, I love to hangout with my friends and spend time with my family. I love to watch movies and some of my favourites include watching the Marvel franchise."

Prepare the Honey Glaze\n\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, combine the honey, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper.\nStir the ingredients together and bring to a simmer.\nLet the glaze simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.\n\n\n\n4. Smoke the Ham\n\nPlace the soaked hickory wood chips in a smoker box or directly on the grill.\nPut the ham in the smoker or on the grill over indirect heat. Smoke for 2-3 hours, basting occasionally with the honey glaze.\n\n\n\n5. Roast the Ham\n\nOnce the ham has been smoked, transfer it to the oven. Roast for an additional 1-1.5 hours, basting with the honey glaze every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C).\n\n\n\n6. Rest and Serve\n\nRemove the ham from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\nServe with your favorite sides and enjoy!"

Mash the Potatoes\n\nUse a potato masher or a potato ricer to mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.\nFor ultra-smooth potatoes, you can use a ricer, which will give them a silky texture.\n\n\n\n5. Add Butter and Milk\n\nAdd the butter to the mashed potatoes and stir until fully melted and incorporated.\nGradually pour in the milk (or heavy cream), stirring until the potatoes are creamy and smooth.\nAdd salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n\n\n\n6.

    "text": "Peggy’s Cove\nOne of our first stops was seeing Peggy’s Cove. This area is not too fat from city as it takes around 40 minutes. We drove by car to get to our destination which was very scenic. I highly recommend taking a road trip around Canada as there is so much to see including wildlife, landscapes etc. Peggy’s Cove is one of Nova Scotia’s prime tourist attractions. This fishing village is along the South shore and was built in 1915. You can spend the day looking at the ocean and appreciating the serenity of the atmosphere. Sometimes, if you are lucky, there are muscicians that will play music and will allow you to take pictures with them! This area has been designated as a preservation region and remains a fishing community. I would highly recommend going to Sou’Western Gifts and Restaurant as the fish and chips were absolutely divine! Seafood is very prominent in Halifax, especially lobster, so if you get the chance I would try at least one seafood related dish."

Along the boardwalk, there are several info boards that have a written documentation of historic events that happened in areas closeby. For those who are history junkies, I would definitely suggest reading those signs as they provide context and cultural background to some of the sites. We managed to visit one of the restaurants, Bar Sofia, which was a Mexican establishment. I had the chance to enjoy some fish tacos which were absolutely amazing!"

    "text": "What is muscle work efficiency?\nAs stated before, physical activity energy expenditure is an important component of total daily energy expenditure. Thus, it is important to understand how physical activity energy changes in adolescents with obesity. Muscle work efficiency refers to the ability of skeletal muscles to convert energy into mechanical work with minimal energy loss. It is a measure of how effectively muscles use energy during phyiscal activity, particularly during contraction. In simpler terms, muscle work efficiency is the ratio of useful work produced by the muscle compared to the energy consumed in the process.\nIt is thought that improvements in muscle work efficiency that occur during weight are potential contributors to adaptive thermogensis. In other words, as muscles get more efficient in burning calories, they burn less calories with the same amount of workload. It is important to understand this concept in order to develop tailored strategies to mitigating adaptive thermogenesis\nPackage for calculating work efficiency\nPackage name: WorkEfficiency\nObjective: The goal of WorkEfficiency is to create a simple and easy way to calculate the total work efficiency during a Metabolic visit at McMaster University. This package will take values from the Total Energy Expended and Resting Energy Expenditure to give a value that corresponds with work efficiency. Both of these values can be obtained experimentally through indirect calorimetry."
