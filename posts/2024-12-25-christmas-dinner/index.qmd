During the last week of school, my roommates and I decided to make a recipe we had never tried previously. Our menu for the night was Hickory roasted ham, Mashed potaotes, brussel sprouts and cinnamon buns! Below are the recipies for each of the meals. 

## Hickory roasted ham 

### Ingredients

- **For the Ham**:
  - 1 (8-10 lbs) bone-in ham
  - 1 cup hickory wood chips (soaked in water for 30 minutes)
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste

- **For the Honey Glaze**:
  - 1 cup honey
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
  - 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1 tsp ground cloves
  - 1/2 tsp ground ginger
  - 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

## Instructions

### 1. **Preheat the Oven**
   Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).

### 2. **Prepare the Ham**
   - Pat the ham dry with paper towels.
   - Rub the ham with olive oil, salt, and pepper to season the surface.

### 3. **Prepare the Honey Glaze**
   - In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the honey, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper.
   - Stir the ingredients together and bring to a simmer.
   - Let the glaze simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.

### 4. **Smoke the Ham**
   - Place the soaked hickory wood chips in a smoker box or directly on the grill.
   - Put the ham in the smoker or on the grill over indirect heat. Smoke for 2-3 hours, basting occasionally with the honey glaze.
   
### 5. **Roast the Ham**
   - Once the ham has been smoked, transfer it to the oven. Roast for an additional 1-1.5 hours, basting with the honey glaze every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C).

### 6. **Rest and Serve**
   - Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.
   - Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy!

## Tips:
- **For a crispy outer layer**, increase the temperature to 400°F during the last 10 minutes of roasting.
- **Leftovers** can be sliced and used for sandwiches or added to soups.

## Mashed Potatoes Recipe


### Ingredients

- 2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 large potatoes)
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup whole milk (or heavy cream for extra richness)
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 cloves garlic (optional)
- Chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Potatoes**
   - Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.
   - If you like garlic mashed potatoes, you can add the garlic cloves, peeled, to the pot while boiling the potatoes.

### 2. **Boil the Potatoes**
   - Place the potatoes (and garlic, if using) in a large pot and cover with cold water.
   - Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat.
   - Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.

### 3. **Drain the Potatoes**
   - Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and return them to the pot.
   - If you added garlic, remove it from the pot.

### 4. **Mash the Potatoes**
   - Use a potato masher or a potato ricer to mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.
   - For ultra-smooth potatoes, you can use a ricer, which will give them a silky texture.

### 5. **Add Butter and Milk**
   - Add the butter to the mashed potatoes and stir until fully melted and incorporated.
   - Gradually pour in the milk (or heavy cream), stirring until the potatoes are creamy and smooth.
   - Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

### 6. **Serve**
   - Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.
   - Serve warm and enjoy!

### 2. **Prepare the Brussels Sprouts**

### 4. **Maple Syrup Glaze**
   - Drizzle the maple syrup and balsamic vinegar over the Brussels sprouts, then toss again to coat evenly.

### 5. **Roast the Brussels Sprouts**
