Last year, I took a trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia with my Aunt and Uncle. It was one of my most favourite experiences as I got a chance to live in the Maritime provinces for a short amount of time. When I was younger my family and I often traveled to various places around Canada including the east coast and I absolutely loved the seaside. Below I will outline some the highlights of my trip and some recommendations for future travelers! 

## Peggy's Cove

One of our first stops was seeing Peggy's Cove. This area is not too fat from city as it takes around 40 minutes. We drove by car to get to our destination which was very scenic. I highly recommend taking a road trip around Canada as there is so much to see including wildlife, landscapes etc. Peggy's Cove is one of Nova Scotia's prime tourist attractions. This fishing village is along the South shore and was built in 1915. You can spend the day looking at the ocean and appreciating the serenity of the atmosphere. Sometimes, if you are lucky, there are muscicians that will play music and will allow you to take pictures with them! This area has been designated as a preservation region and remains a fishing community. I would highly recommend going to Sou'Western Gifts and Restaurant as the fish and chips were absolutely divine! Seafood is very prominent in Halifax, especially lobster, so if you get the chance I would try at least one seafood related dish.

## Point Pleasant Park 

Another place that made it to my highlights was Point Pleasant Park located in the south end of the Halifax peninsula. This spot is great for hikes during the fall and summer time. This area is also pet friendly and filled with dogs running around. We walked through the entie park and managed to catch glimpses of the ocean, and rich forestry. It was a great break from being inside all day and we managed to even catch the sunrise that day. I would highly recommend if you enjoy being out in nature!

## Halifax Harbour 

The Halifax harbour is one of the most popular places downtown. Here, you can find several places to walk, shop and eat along the boardwalk. Sometimes, you can catch various individuals performing circus acts, music and plays. Along the boardwalk, there are several info boards that have a written documentation of historic events that happened in areas closeby. For those who are history junkies, I would definitely suggest reading those signs as they provide context and cultural background to some of the sites. We managed to visit one of the restaurants, Bar Sofia, which was a Mexican establishment. I had the chance to enjoy some fish tacos which were absolutely amazing!

## Overall Rating

I would rate my trip to Halifax an 8.5/10! Again, I would recommend this destination for those who enjoy being out in nature and appreciate the seaside. There are many spots to travel in Halifax, however these are some of my favourites.
